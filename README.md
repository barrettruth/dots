# dots

My personal dotfiles, including configurations for neovim, zsh, ghostty, tmux,
as well as os-specific files for MacOS and Arch Linux.

The directory structure mirrors that of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, for
example:

- `etc`: `/etc` related linux files
- `.config`: osx + linux related files

`./pkgs` contains miscellaneous package versioning metadata (cargo, go, pacman, etc.).
